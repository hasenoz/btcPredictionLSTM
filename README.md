# btcPredictionLSTM
Bitcoin price prediction due to Bitcoin's close prices.

The script is designed to fetch historical Bitcoin price data, apply machine learning techniques to train an LSTM model on this data, and then use the model to predict future Bitcoin prices. It includes preprocessing steps such as scaling the data, setting up and training an LSTM neural network, and evaluating the model's performance by comparing its predictions with actual historical prices. The ultimate goal is to create a predictive model that can accurately forecast future movements in Bitcoin prices using historical data.
